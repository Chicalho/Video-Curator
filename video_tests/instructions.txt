These 2 folders "original" and "substitute" are used to test Curator.js (and FilePolice.js, for duplicates)


*************** TO CREATE BASE VDO's:

duplicate "original" folder and rename it to "test"

open browser and run app 

clear local storage

use filepicker in app to target "test"

this creates a brand new list of VDOs

use save button in app, it will add "test" file tree to local storage


*************** TO TEST UPDATE ROUTINE:

delete "test" folder

duplicate "substitute" folder and rename it to "test"

use filepicker in app to target "test"

this will update the previous list VDOs with the new file tree

(This should perform all Curator options, except the unresolved routine because FilePolice sees unresolved as duplicates beforehand)
